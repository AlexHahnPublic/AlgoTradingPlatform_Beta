# AlgoTradingPlatform_Beta

After working at an Investment bank in technology and automations for over two
years I've decided that a substancial project that could
demonstrate my merit and expertise would be to take what I've learned and build
a full, front to back, STP, trading platform.

This project will entail original ground up development using technologies 
including: Python (Scripting, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy, etc), MySQL 
(InnoDB Storage Engine), Shell/Bash scripting, and a customized Linux Ubuntu
environment dual booted on my mac book and fine tuned solely for this project.

For more information and a letter of intent please have a look at the
letterOfIntent.txt file. For a list of resources used/ recommended, please see
the resourcesAndRequirements.txt file. Both files are located in the root
directory for the project.
