# AlgoTradingPlatform_Beta

This project will entail ground up development using technologies
including: Python (Scripting, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy, etc), MySQL
(InnoDB Storage Engine), Shell/Bash scripting, and a customized Linux Ubuntu
environment dual booted on my mac book and fine tuned solely for this project.

Walk through of Michael Halls-Moore's "Success Algorithmic Trading" Ebook. I'd
highly recommend purchasing a copy as the code really does not mean much
without context. The system is more pedagogical (read not realistic/profitable) and the main
benefit is walking through and taking a look at each piece of the stack. The
book can be purchased at Quantstart.com
