# AlgoTradingPlatform_Beta

After working at an Investment bank in technology and automations for over two
years I've decided that a substancial project that could
demonstrate my merit and expertise would be to take what I've learned and build
a full, front to back, STP, trading platform.

This project will entail original ground up development using technologies
including: Python (Scripting, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy, etc), MySQL
(InnoDB Storage Engine), Shell/Bash scripting, and a customized Linux Ubuntu
environment dual booted on my mac book and fine tuned solely for this project.

For more information and a letter of intent please have a look at the
letterOfIntent.txt file. For a list of resources used/ recommended, please see
the resourcesAndRequirements.txt file. Both files are located in the root
directory for the project.

Please note that the first iteration of building a trading platform will be a
walk through of Michael Halls-Moore's "Success Algorithmic Trading" Ebook. I'd
highly recommend purchasing a copy as the code really does not mean much
without context. The system as it stands is not profitable and the main
benefit is walking through and taking a look at each piece of the stack. The
book can be purchased at Quantstart.com
