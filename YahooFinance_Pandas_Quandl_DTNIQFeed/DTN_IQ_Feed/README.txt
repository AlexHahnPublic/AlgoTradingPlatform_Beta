DTN IQ feed is a high-end data feed provider for retail algorithmic traders.
Because of it's attractive price per data availability (relatively cheap 
intraday data) and accuracy it should be considered/ explored at some point in 
time by those developing their automated data market data retrieval stack.

Two main points should be noted:
    - the cost claims to start around 50$ but in reality ends up in the 
      150-200$
      range for all of the features and services that most subscriptions
      would need

    - The API can only be accessed through either a native Windows OS or by
      running through the WINE emulator on Linux or Mac. This is a
      requirement and may require some additional upkeep in the future.
